What is KOAM?

KOAM, King of All Memes (KOAM), holds the title as the King of the Forest.
Why KOAM?

Fraud, Scams, and corruption reign over the World of memes. Hence, the time has come for the king's return. The king will assert his dominion over the Meme Forest, oust the corrupt, and enforce the law with unwavering strength.
Unlike other MEMEs/TOKENs offerings such as PRESALEs, ICOs, and AIRDROPs, which are often associated with SCAMS and Rug Pulls, KOAM has taken a different approach to ensure transparency and fairness. A 95.5 % of the total KOAM supply was locked in the liquidity pool, allowing everyone to freely buy the token. Additionally, a buy limit was implemented for the initial day of launch, ensuring a fair distribution and granting more crypto traders the chance to acquire the token at the low price. This measure aims to prevent gamblers and whales from accumulating an excessive portion of the token supply.
 100% of liquidity LP token ( was locked for 7 years at  uncx.network ) ,The locked liquidity pool will be unlocked after in 1/1/2030 , by multi-sig KOAM  community funds wallet (which will be multi-sig wallet), which will be controlled by the community. The ownership of locked liquidity transferred transferred to community funds wallet.
